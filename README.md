# Code_Sample_Question2
This code, takes an array, and an integer K as input.
Creates all subarrays having length K.
Prints the largest subarray among them, based on the following criteria!

X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ; 
Y = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]

Here array Y is greater than X, because the first different value(4 of Y) is greater than the first different value(3 of X).    
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
